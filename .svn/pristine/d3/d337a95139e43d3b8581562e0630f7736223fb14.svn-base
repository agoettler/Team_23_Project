 * Introduction to Software Design Fall 2014
 * Game: Duck Hunt
 * Authors: 
 * 		Andrew Goettler
 * 		Joshua Svenson
 * Team Project: Arcade Game Redux
 * Problem Description: The goal of this project is to implement a classic arcade game in JavaTM 
 * 		with modern twists. A tutorial is provided for help getting started implementing the 
 * 		graphics, but this is intended as a guide and not as free code to just use. 
 * 		Because help is provided for the graphics, you may want to try and differentiate 
 * 		your game from other students by adding new and unique features.
 * Problem Documentation:
